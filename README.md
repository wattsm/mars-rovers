An F# implementation of the [Mars Rovers interview puzzle](http://www.techinterviewpuzzles.com/2010/09/mars-rovers-thoughtworks-puzzles.html#Mars_Rovers_Puzzle), using a [single case union](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-single-case-dus/) model. [I have written a blog post about this repository](https://blog.tryfinally.xyz/programming/fsharp/2014/11/18/modeling-mars-rovers-with-fsharp/).
